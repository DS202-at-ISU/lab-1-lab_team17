# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

Ashraf - I dealt with fixing merge conflicts. So my friend pushed some
changes to the remote. I made some local changes and committed but
couldn’t push. So I had to pull first but this caused conflicts.
Therefore I had to edit merge conflicts and then commit and then push.

Nicholas - The experience in this lab is very good, we learned how to
use git, using push, pull, add, and commit. Which will be very useful in
the future, or even other classes. It has been a very productive class.
Being able to track changes, collaborate with classmates, and manage
version control is going to make group projects so much smoother.
